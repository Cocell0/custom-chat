## Custom Chat

#development

- Use the "secret-plugin" for users to generate a **public key** and a **private key**.
- Ensure that users understand how to use this new Custom Chat system.
- Setup a system to generate keys and have it saved for users.
- Setup another system to listen to each message and decrypt every message that starts "ENCRYPTED" and then notify the user about the results.
- Compose small, easy-to-understand information specific to each interface.

Draft instructions regarding this in a simple manner:
The **public key** and **private key** are generated by the user who sends the invitation. The inviter must share the **public key** publicly when needed.

The user being invited must then use the **public key** to generate an encrypted code for the channel.

The system setup on the user's (the one that made the invitation) device would listen to the messages and then notify the user about it.

The invited user will use the **public key** to generate an encrypted code for the channel.

The system on the inviter’s device will then listen to messages and notify the inviter when a message is decrypted.

## New Custom Chat system

Hello everyone. 

These are the words you need to keep in mind:

- **Encrypt**: Encrypt means to change an information into a code so that only someone with the correct key can decrypt it.
  
  **Decrypt**: Decrypt means to convert an encrypted information back into its original form so that it can be read.
  
  **Public key**: A **public key** is a code that you can share with anyone. It is used to encrypt messages that only you can decrypt with *your* **private key**.
  
  **Private key**: A **private key** is a secret code that only you have. It is used to decrypt messages that were encrypted with *your* **public key**.

### How to use this system

To be frank, you need to follow these steps to invite someone:

- You generate a pair of **public key** and **private key**.

- You share the **public key** with the person you want to invite.

- They need to use *your* **public key** to generate an invitation code and encrypt it.

- Since your **public key** and **private key** are linked together, you use *your* **private key** to decrypt *their* encrypted invitation code.

- This ensures

To use the Custom Chat system, you'll first need to generate two keys: a **public key** and a **private key**.

The **public key** and **private key** are *linked together* because they are created as a matching pair. The **public key** is used to encrypt messages, and only the **private key**, which is kept secret, can decrypt those messages, making sure that only the intended recipient can read them.

Here is how it works:

- The **public key** is meant to be shared publicly with anyone who needs to send encrypted messages to you. The **public key** cannot be used for any purpose other than encrypting a message that can only be decrypted by *you*. 
- The **private key** should remain secret and only be used by you to decrypt messages sent to you. ***It is NEVER shared***. The **private key** cannot be used for any purpose other than decrypting a message that is created by *your* **public key**.

Once the inviter shares their **public key**, the invited user will use it to encrypt their messages.

On the inviter’s side, the system will listen for these encrypted messages. When it detects one, it will automatically decrypt it and notify the inviter about the result. This ensures that only the inviter can read the encrypted messages.

Simply put: share the **public key** so that others can encrypt their messages, keep the **private key** safe to decrypt them, and the system will do the rest.



> "If you want to decrypt something, but you've lost your private key, I'm afraid it's gone forever. A trillion dollars and a personal army of PhDs from the NSA's math department would probably not be enough to get your data back." — **The Perchance developer**

This is what the developer of Perchance said, so make sure you store **public key** and **private key** secrurely.
