# Todo

- Add a delay between which the chats are added to support subtle animations
- Add rate limiting on boot so that the client's system is not overwhelmed
- Use buttons for cards in normal mode and remove the open button which becomes redundant
- Modify the function to build the interface based on conditioms to make it more flexible
- Add 'Edit' option, which would rebuild the all the custom chat cards with input fields to allow users to edit their values, and add a delete button to move them to the 'Bin' so that the user can change their mind within a 30-day period
- Implement the following features:
  - **Folders** to allow the users to organize their chat list
  - **Archiving** so that the user can archive their chats
  - **Searching** so that the user can search for their chats
  - **Tags** to allow the users to define specific tags or select tags that were used previously, allowing the user to search by tags
  - Add settings interface so that users can customize the app's behaviors
  - Add floating windows to view multiple chats at once
- Ensure the chat is highly customizable.
